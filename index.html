                <p> Hi my name is Mitchell Easterling. I am a starting Web Developer currently attending Ku Bootcamp for Full Stack Development.
                    This is my basic portfolio that will be updated as i learn more about Html, CSS, and javascript.
                    I am happy to say this page was built using basic HTML and CSS to start out with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I enjoy this Bootcamp because at every turn it challenges us to keep working on developing our skills.
                    This bootcamp never lets you stop learning and build projects.
                </p>
